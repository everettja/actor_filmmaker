        <h3>About Jonathan</h3>
          
            <p>Jonathan Everett was born in small town Tullahoma, Tennessee. Seemingly from birth, he had the heart of an entertainer and storyteller. Lost (or very well-hidden...) home videos depict him dancing to Tina Turner and trying way too hard to be funny. Something he described as having "jokes in my mouth." <a href="#" class="read_more">Read more!</a></p>
            <span class="more_text">
            <p>Still, it wasn't until post-college adult life that he found an outlet in film acting. Dedicating himself to the craft, he landed his first film role as the villain in a local production. Since then, Jonathan has performed in dozens of projects in television, feature films, short films, music videos, and web series.</p>
            <p>Flexibility and range are the defining characteristics of Jonathan's acting style. Prominent projects include indie flick, "What's the Matter With Gerald?", televsion's "Murder Comes to Town," and the award-winning web series, "Johnny Dynamo." His writing, producing, and directorial debut, "The Heart Heist," also took 3rd place in the 54 Film Fest.</p>
            <p>2017 will see a lot of expansion in Jonathan's career. His latest starring role in comedy is aiming for an April premiere, and he's set to play the ruthless and lethal villain of Omega Pictures' upcoming "Day: 7." And, to top it all off, production for "The Last Laugh," is expected to begin in the summer. The film will be Jonathan's first solo-writing project, in which he will co-direct, co-produce, and star.</p>
